# Enjoy the View

Hi my name is Joe.vB and I am making an app in Vue for the first time.

Im tracking my project with a Kanban board, to plan a workflow to create the key features of my app.

I want a basic video carousel and a player, and a list to keep track of watched videos. I want to host it on Heroku. As stretch I'll put together some Codeceptjs tests.

Wish me luck!
